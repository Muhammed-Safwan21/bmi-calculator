# BMI Calculator

A simple React application that calculates BMI (Body Mass Index) based on user input for weight and height.

# Features

Automatically calculates the BMI using the provided weight and height.  
Displays the calculated BMI and the corresponding weight category.  
Applies different background colors to the result box based on the weight category.  


# Technologies Used
React  
JavaScript  
HTML  
CSS  

# Usage

Enter your weight in kilograms in the provided input field.  
Enter your height in centimeters in the provided input field.  
The BMI value will be calculated and displayed.  
The weight category will be shown along with a corresponding background color in the result box.  


# BMI Categories
The weight categories are defined as follows:

BMI < 18.5: Underweight (Blue background color)  
BMI >= 18.5 and BMI < 25: Normal Weight (Green background color)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
